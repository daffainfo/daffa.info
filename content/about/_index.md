## Muhammad Daffa
Hello! I'm Muhammad Daffa, but you can call me Daffa. I started getting into cybersecurity around 2019 to 2020. It all kicked off when some of my Facebook friends were posting about making money through something called 'bug bounty.' I got curious and decided to dive in myself, focusing mostly on website penetration testing.

I'm not a pro pentester just yet—there’s still a ton I haven’t explored, like testing Android, iOS, or IoT. But hey, I’m learning and loving the process.

## Contact
Contact me if you have something to discuss or if you have a great resource about cybersecurity, i'll be very happy to read about the resource :D
