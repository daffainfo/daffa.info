## Muhammad Daffa
Hi! I'm Muhammad Daffa, you can call me Daffa. I started learning about cyber security between 2019 / 2020. I was interested in cybersecurity when my facebook friends posted about how they get money doing an activity called "bug bounty". From that post, I tried to learn more about cybersecurity, especially penetration testing on website

Don't ever think I'm a professional penetration tester :D. There are still a lot of things about cyber security that I haven't learned, such as doing penetration testing on Android, iOS, or even on the network. Right now I'm learning about malware analysis too, thanks to TCM Security <3

## Contact
Contact me if you have something to discuss or if you have a great resource about cybersecurity, i'll be very happy to read about the resource :D
